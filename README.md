# Lazy Loading

Loading all the images in one page at once worse makes user experience worse. While scrolling, render only images in the intersection with [Viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport)

- [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)


## Requirements
- spread out images within Grid.
- apply lazy loading to images.
